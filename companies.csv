Notion,Series C,"Creative Lead, Web",Marketing,"New York, New York","&lt;h3&gt;About Us&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can&#39;t build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we&#39;re growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We&#39;re passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp;amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;About the role&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notion’s Creative Team is a group of strategists, designers, illustrators, filmmakers, writers, technologists, and producers that deliver on all of Notion’s brand and creative expressions. We’re looking for a talented Creative Lead for our website to guide design and planning for our most important touchpoint, &lt;a href=&quot;http://notion.com&quot;&gt;notion.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What you&#39;ll achieve&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Web Design Lead, you will be responsible for collaboratively shaping the vision for our web design system and key projects, launches, and other special initiatives that contribute to driving excellence in craft and performance for our marketing site. This role reports to the Head of Creative and will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure a seamless web experience.&lt;/strong&gt; Develop and maintain Notion’s web presence, ensuring consistency in design, usability, and performance across all web properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead web creative strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; Partner with cross-functional teams, including Marketing, Product, and Design, to define and execute a cohesive web strategy that aligns with Notion’s brand and business goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovate through web design and technology.&lt;/strong&gt; Utilize the latest web technologies and design trends to create engaging and interactive web experiences that captivate and convert users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oversee E2E web projects.&lt;/strong&gt; Manage web projects from initial concept through to final execution, coordinating with stakeholders, setting timelines, and ensuring deliverables are met on schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster a collaborative web culture.&lt;/strong&gt; Educate and mentor team members on web design best practices, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation within the web creative team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Skills you&#39;ll need to bring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A maker and manager:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll mentor and motivate a talented team of interaction designers, while designing often, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7+ years experience&lt;/strong&gt; in creative work focused on UX / web projects either in-house or agency-side; 2+ years managing a team of 3+. Work in SaaS, or experience across both B2B and B2C audiences a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highest bar for quality of design:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re still active in your craft and comfortable pitching in wherever needed to help your team. You’re a strong collaborator to Eng / PM leads, and with experience working with these functions as well as TPgM. You consider a11y and usability best practices in motivating your decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional eye for detail at every stage:&lt;/strong&gt; You sweat the small stuff, from mobile breakpoints to janky motion. And you consider details in a broader sense as well, emphasizing evidence-led design decision-making, user behavior understanding, coherent journey formation across our website, and an intuitive and seasoned grasp for what will resonate in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systems thinker:&lt;/strong&gt; You delight in building scalable, repeatable systems for a rapidly growing business, and in finding ways to modernize and bring delight to users and prospective customers across B2B and B2C and a range of audiences and profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pacesetting and inspiring leader:&lt;/strong&gt; You motivate your team with mentorship, commitment, and optimism. You define goals and track progress with TPgM Lead and ops partners. You are unfazed by ambiguous problem areas and thrive at running ambitious plans through to completion — even as requirements and priorities shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative champion:&lt;/strong&gt; You have both empathy and passion for being an essential part of the creative process and view the quality of the team’s work as a direct reflection of your own. You’ve led major web work before, and can exemplify best practices and model customer-centricity in your efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outstanding communication skills:&lt;/strong&gt; You are able to articulate a vision, strategy, or idea clearly, keep your team organized, and forge strong partnerships across diverse sets of stakeholders. You’re comfortable leading cross-team and/or multi-phase projects from ideation through implementation E2E. Your documentation and planning decisions help make ambiguity more tractable to unblock your team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nice-to-haves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience using Notion - bonus points for both personal and work use!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the team can code front-end, so coding knowledge (CSS, HTML, JS, React (Next.js), TypeScript) a plus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.
